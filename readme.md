Facial Recognition
Speech Recognition
Multiprocessing for parallel face and speech recognition
    Facial recognition in main program

GUI for drink selection (in case speech recognition unavailable (too loud))
    Button to save face and name


Originally saved face when uniqueness was over a threshold, but too many false positives (i.e. saving faces when they had already been saved)

Main.py runs processes FR, SR, GUI, which all communicate with Main.py
